Question:\\
\emph{

technologies?
}\\\\

\emph{[00:09:56] then third is justify the investment do you think the investment that governments make worldwide
and and and they do actually um in data warehousing and data mining is justified is the return on investment
up in the case i explained some benefits but i also need you not only to take a copy of that but
to discuss it do you think yes it brings value back to them how do you think would that value be
identified and reaped and attained by those governments}\\\\

What to do here?
\begin{enumerate}
    \item motivate why data warehousing is a good idea for the Census Bureau
    \item motivate why data mining is a good idea for the Census Bureau
  \end{enumerate}
