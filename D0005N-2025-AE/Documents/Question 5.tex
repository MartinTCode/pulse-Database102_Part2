Question:\\
\emph{
    Do you think that there exists a need for data marts? Justify either the Y or the N.
}\\

What to do here?
\begin{enumerate}
    \item possible uses of data marts
    \item pros of using data marts in this case
    \item cons of using data marts in this case
    \item summarize and answer yes or no
    \item motivate the yes/no using the already listed pros/cons
  \end{enumerate}

% see how to write a mathematical formula below (note: this line is marked as comment!)
Let $a$ and $b$ be distinct positive integers, and let $c = a - b + 1$

$\mu = a + b $


$\Omega = a - b $

$y = c_2 x^2 + c_1 x + c_0 $

The roots of a quadratic equation are given by:

\begin{equation}
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}} {2a}
\end{equation}

where $a$, $b$ and $c$ are \ldots
