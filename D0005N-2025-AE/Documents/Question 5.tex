Answers to Question 5:

% see how to write a mathematical formula below (note: this line is marked as comment!)
Let $a$ and $b$ be distinct positive integers, and let $c = a - b + 1$

$\mu = a + b $


$\Omega = a - b $

$y = c_2 x^2 + c_1 x + c_0 $

The roots of a quadratic equation are given by:

\begin{equation}
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}} {2a}
\end{equation}

where $a$, $b$ and $c$ are \ldots
