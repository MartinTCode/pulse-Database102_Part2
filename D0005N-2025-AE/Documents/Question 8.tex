Question:\\
\emph{
    AI penetration:\\
- Governments worldwide, especially in Sweden, are interested in adopting AI.
But there is no AI without data.\\ So, in your opinion, how does the layered BI
architecture you proposed in Q.1 need to change to respond to the future AI and
analytics needs of the various government use cases that emerge over time?
}\\

\emph{[00:17:15] question eight of course i will open the floor uh soon after i
finish explaining those questions to you to ask um any question that you might have is about ai penetration
uh so so here we all know that there is a huge interest in ai uh worldwide and specifically some
some governments are putting uh huge investments and plans on this including the swedish government
yeah so in your opinion does the layered bi architecture you provided in question number
one need to change to the future ai and analytics needs or no you took that into account because i also
made that relationship and statement in the beginning i said that yeah there is no ai without data
yeah so here when we set that foundation um to government agencies to the architecture of those government
agencies do you think that this is yeah it took into account the plans of the government to penetrate
more and more use cases using ai yeah or no i really need to rethink and probably add another component
to my layered architecture to cater to the needs of governments when they plan for more use cases
of ai yeah}\\

What to do here?
