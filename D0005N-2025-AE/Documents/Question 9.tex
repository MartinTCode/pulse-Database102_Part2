\emph{[00:18:45] the last question is about the field exercise we learn things in that course and then
it would be great if we can also hear from experts or specialists consultants so so you need to contact
maybe the census office a data warehouse vendor like those names up here or otherwise microsoft oracle ibm etc any
one of those names including as well and then ask that could be a government also agency using
data warehousing data warehousing or a private sector and it's almost everybody is doing so and then ask
preferably in sweden but it's also okay to have that person from outside the nordics ask different
questions yeah but the person should have expertise with data warehousing or etl or data warehouse
administration data warehouse design uh like a sales engineer a consultant business analyst the data
scientist or a data warehouse manager so so this is like propose the titles for the persons that you could interview
interview and then ask them those questions what is the value of a data warehouse in decision making
which decisions could be supported via the data warehouse what is the role of analytic sandbox in
today's business intelligence environment and how do you select an olap tool then you need to report
the interview and the answers of that person you will interview to the questions and then put your
insights has that brought new knowledge to you does this come in line with the knowledge that you have
obtained in the course or is it against what you have learned this has triggered some new knowledge to me
this has motivated me to do more research etc so i want you to add your reflection on the answers that
you have obtained yeah and then that all goes into a report}\\

\section{Interview Questions}

\subsection{What is the value of data warehouse to decision making?}

In the interview, see Appendix~\ref{sec:interview}, a representative from a housing development company emphasized the critical role of their data platform 
in decision-making. While they use a data lakehouse rather than a traditional data warehouse, the platform provides valuable 
insights across multiple areas, including finance, health and safety, sales, and marketing.

For example, project leads access continuously updated reports to monitor cost trends, safety compliance, and project performance. 
This enables them to quickly identify cost overruns and optimize spending. Marketing teams use the platform to track campaign 
effectiveness, assessing ROI across different channels to refine their strategies. Similarly, sales teams analyze data to understand 
which projects sell quickly and which require additional effort, helping optimize pricing and marketing tactics.

Overall, the company's centralized data platform enhances operational efficiency, financial oversight, and strategic planning, 
demonstrating the importance of robust data infrastructure in modern business decision-making.
