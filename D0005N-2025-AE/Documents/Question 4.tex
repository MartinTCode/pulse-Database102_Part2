Question:\\
\emph{
    Design a DW that should be used at Census Bureaus. Logical design only.\\ Focus on only
one fact + five dimensions.\\ 5 attributes per table are required.\\ The point should include
measures. Relationships should be shown.
}\\\\
\emph{[00:10:33] then fourth question is about design question so this is where you design a data warehouse but then do i need to design a fully
fledged end to end the data warehouse for a census office no that's not required so here it's a logical
design focus on one factor plus five dimensions so this is like a small uniscope data warehouse five
attributes per table are required and the points should also include uh the measures uh in the fact
five attributes on the dimension and the measures on the facts and then you need also to show the
relationship like i have explained um in this week's lecture about the one to many relationships
yeah which now some students usually ask yeah what is it about yeah that that is where you have freedom
to decide so um if i go back here just to give you some more explanation on this question if i go here
so this is of course that's not a data warehouse model these are the areas about which the census offices
collect and maintain data and offer insights uh to those interested yeah so for example you might
say i will do my star schema data warehouse about the population so you need to have
fact and five dimensions about population another student would come and say i will do it about fishery and
then third i will do it about trade and i will do it about housing which one do you choose this is up to you
so i leave that in your hands uh subject to your interest uh yeah you decide uh yeah on question number four
four}\\\\
What to do here?
\begin{enumerate}
    \item decide 1 fact and 5 dimensions to use
    \item make a dimension diagram
    \item include relationships
    \item decide attributes (at least 5 per table)
  \end{enumerate}
